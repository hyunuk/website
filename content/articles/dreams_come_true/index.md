Ten years ago, I started to learn English from scratch, literally from “I am a boy”.

After I could express myself a little bit comfy, then I’ve desired more and more. Long story short, I applied and received a permanent residency of Canada, traveled around the world, immigrated to Canada, and changed my whole career.

When I accepted to the UBC, I set my goal to “join Google”.
Why Google? I thought they are the best company, and if I study really hard with some luck and talent, then I might get there. Even if I failed though I tried, my effort will never betray me and it will make me a better developer.

I applied for internships to 100+ companies every year after I entered UBC in 2018. I can remember my first interview, which I completely ruined after not sleeping nor eating from the night before.

From then on, the company that I applied for each every six months, that didn’t let me pass even a single resume review stage til I’ve done three internships and solved 480+ Leetcode problems, eventually opened the door and accepted me.

This summer, I am going to start working as a developer relations intern at Google NYC! Thank you so much to everyone helped me.
